# Wireframes for GbgZoo.se
I had a general idea for the layout in the UX phase of the project however I tend to stray from this when coding the site as I enjoy experimenting with different things and layouts while I code. Therefor I only made a general wireframe and improvised from there. I ran out of time so I could not create wireframes for the things that I coded after the innitial wireframes.
