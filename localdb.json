The cooler end of the enclosure can be kept at about 30 degrees.", "feeding_schedule": "Bearded dragons are omnivorous, meaning they eat both animal and plant matter. They are not usually picky and eat with gusto. Insects, such as crickets and mealworms, should be dusted with a vitamin/mineral supplement and calcium. Dusting can be achieved by placing the insects in a plastic bag with some of the powder, and shaking the bag to lightly coat the insects prior to offering them to your lizards. Also offer bearded dragons finely chopped veggies (such as romaine lettuce, zucchini, carrots, etc.), greens (collard, mustard, dandelion, etc.) and fruit (kiwi, banana, mango, etc.). Use healthy, vitamin-rich items; sprinkle the appropriate amount of powdered supplements on these foods, too. Avoid iceberg lettuce because it is not nutritious.

Ensure that the water bowl is not too deep for juvenile animals – 1 inch or so will suffice. Snakes of many species will defecate in their water bowls from time to time, so be prepared to clean and disinfect the water bowl. The water bowl should be cleaned and disinfected on a weekly basis. Having a spare water bowl for such occasions can be handy, so that one may be used while the other is being cleaned. Ball pythons are generally shy and will spend much of their time hiding. Your ball python may initially see you as a threat and it must learn who you are. The goal is to establish trust between you and your snake. Always support your ball python’s body and avoid fast movements. Once a ball python realizes that you will not hurt it they often seem to enjoy being handled. Some ball pythons may try to hide when handled and occasionally there are ones that may even bite due to excessive fear. These ball pythons may require a bit more time to settle in and establish trust. A ball python’s bite is a superficial wound. If a snake looks like it is going to strike, it is best to not handle it. Relax when holding your animal – sit down and give the animal a chance to settle.", "cage_setup": "Newspapers and paper towels are the cheapest and easiest substrates for ball pythons with regards to cleaning and disinfecting – out with the old, in with the new. Cypress mulch and orchid bark are great substrates for controlling humidity, but remember that too much humidity can be as detrimental (if not more) as too little. Never use any substrate containing cedar, as it contains oils that can be deadly to reptiles! Avoid sand, shavings and peat bedding. The ideal Ball Python setup is one with plenty of hiding spaces and cover for the snake to feel secure. Because of the humidity requirements bio-active setups are perfect for this species. Make sure to have at least one hiding spot such as a cave on either end of the enclosure as to provide the snake the opportunity to regulate its temperature.

After a snake has eaten it may be a good idea to limit the handling because it may be uncomfortable for the animal. Avoid putting your snake’s cage in a heavy traffic area, excessive movement, and other pets should be avoided. Ball pythons are well-known for not eating at certain times throughout the year, particularly in the winter months. Be prepared for the possibility of your ball python going off feed, and keep an observant eye on the snake’s overall condition and body weight. This is typically nothing to worry about with healthy, well-established pythons, although it can be extremely frustrating to the snake keeper. If your ball python is healthy, continue your husbandry routine as usual, but keep the amount of handling to a minimum.

Some snakes will gently take food off hemostats, or they may prefer having food left in a quiet corner of the enclosure to eat at their leisure. Others will emerge from their enclosures ready for food with mouths open. No matter which type of behavior your animal displays, use hemostats, tongs or forceps to reduce the chance of an accidental bite.", "cage_setup": "A Western hognose does require a secure cage, even though it is not as adept at escape as other snakes.

One of these can be used to provide a hot spot basking area maintained at about 90 degrees Fahrenheit for your Western hognose. Be sure to get an appropriately sized heater to allow for a heat gradient—you don’t want it to heat more than one-third of the enclosure, so the snake can get away from the heat if desired—and never use medical heat pads found in pharmacies. While these may be adjustable, they can be potential fire hazards, or overheat the enclosure. Hot rocks are also to be avoided. The cooler end of the enclosure can be maintained in the high 70s. Keep this heat pad regulated with the Zilla Heat Habitat Thermostat Controller.\r\n\r\nMany Western hognose breeders house many snakes in rack systems. In a rack set-up, heat tape and a programmable thermostat or rheostat combination is most commonly used to provide heat. These can be purchased from reptile specialty stores or online. Heat tape is normally affixed to the shelving the enclosure sits on or in, and is a very good and easily manageable method for heating the enclosures in a rack.", "feeding_schedule": "Established Western hognoses are usually eager feeders; some will come at you with open mouths appearing to say, “Feed me!” For stocky snakes, Western hognoses can be quick, and they often don’t follow the standard practice of striking at prey head-on—they will strike at food items from any direction. For these reasons, it’s best to use tongs, forceps or hemostats when feeding Western hognoses.\r\n\r\nIt is best to feed an appropriately sized meal—meaning a prey item that’s about the same diameter as the snake’s head—one to two times per week. Once it has been swallowed it should produce a noticeable lump, but not one that is so large that it is still noticeable 24 hours later. In the wild, Western hognoses consume a variety of prey items, including small rodents, lizards, amphibians and the eggs of ground-nesting animals. Pets do very well on a diet of pre-killed or frozen/thawed mice. Many Western hognose keepers prefer frozen/thawed rodents because they are easier for the snake to digest; at the cellular level, the food item has been broken down by about half. Also, as with pre-killed mice, the risk of your Western hognose being injured by a live mouse is eliminated.", "known_problems": "Some hatchling Western hognoses can be challenging to get to accept mice. Scenting a thawed pinky mouse with canned tuna or salmon juice is easy and may encourage these snakes to eat. It usually gets good results, and it’s easy to wean the snakes off this form of scenting in a very short time. Sometimes “braining” a pinky works well, too, although this is not for the squeamish. It involves making a small pinhole in the skull of a frozen/thawed pinky, and squeezing a bit of brain matter out to smear on the mouse’s nose.\r\n\r\nIt is not recommended that toads be used as a scenting medium for Western hognoses. Using toads can introduce dangerous parasites to the snake, and it can also be difficult to wean small Western hognoses off toad-scented mice.

Full-spectrum bulbs with UVB like the Solar Glo all in one reptile lamp, may provide physical and physiological benefits to boas, but this has not been proven. UVB lighting is not needed for the proper care of boas, and the vast majority of boa keepers do not use it. Still, it won’t harm your boa, so feel free to provide it just in case there is some benefit.", "heating": "Boas control their body temperature through thermoregulation, and the cage should have a warm side and a cool side. This is very important! Do not place the heat source in the center of the cage, place it at one end. Then if the boa gets too warm, it will move toward the cooler side, and if it is too cool, it will move to the warmer side. That’s thermoregulation!\r\n\r\nThe temperatures in the cool end your boa cage should not drop below 75 degrees Fahrenheit. The warm side should be 85 degrees, with a hot spot of 90 degrees provided by an under-cage heating device that will provide “belly heat.” Boa constrictors greatly prefer this, so they can coil over the rising heat.\r\n\r\nBelly heat can be provided using various devices. Under-tank heaters are the most readily available, such as a Zilla heat pad. Heat cable and heat tape are other possibilities. Any heating device should be controlled with a proportional thermostat or rheostat, such as the Zilla heat and temperature controller. Some heat sources, especially heat tape, can get too hot for some enclosures, and they must be regulated not just for the boa’s safety, but yours, too. If using these devices, especially if you’re using a glass enclosure such as an aquarium, be sure some ventilation is provided around the heat source. If heat builds up, it can crack the bottom of a glass tank, or cause other caging materials to melt or overheat.", "feeding_schedule": "It is very important to allow your new boa to acclimate to its new surroundings before feeding. Never attempt to feed a new boa for at least five days after you bring it home. I assure you your new boa will be fine without food during this time. If you feed it too soon, while it may still be stressed from the move to your home, the snake may regurgitate. If this occurs, be sure your temperatures are correct, and do not attempt to feed the boa again for two weeks. The most common causes of regurgitation are improper temperature and stress from being handled, so be sure you provide proper cage temperatures and do not excessively handle boas after meals.\r\n\r\nNever feed a new boa constrictor a meal that is larger than the snake’s mid-body girth. It should never exhibit a bulge after eating. Especially in young boas, a meal that is too large may lead to regurgitation. An established boa will handle a meal resulting in a small bulge just fine.\r\n\r\nPet boa constrictors should be fed only quality mice or rats. They need no additional food or supplementation. Be sure you buy your rodents from a good source to prevent disease and mites. Boas 2 years old and younger should be fed one appropriately sized rodent every seven to 10 days. Excessive feeding may lead to regurgitation, improper growth, and even premature death. Once boas near adulthood, they will thrive while being fed every 10 to 14 days. It is okay to feed your boa more or less often, but be sure to monitor weight so the boa does not become obese or underweight.\r\n\r\nMost boa constrictors available as pets will be eating frozen/thawed prey. If you purchase one that is eating live rodents, it will often take frozen/thawed prey that is presented from a pair of tongs. Pre-killed rodents are always best, whether they are frozen/thawed or freshly killed, because live rodents may harm your boa. If your snake does not kill its prey (boas will not eat if they are not hungry or are kept under improper conditions), the rodent may bite or even kill your boa. Even if the boa does constrict its prey, the rodent may bite before it is killed. Never leave your boa unattended with live rodents.", "known_problems": "Shedding issues are usually a result of insufficient humidity. A soak or two during the shed cycle will greatly help if you are experiencing low-humidity issues. Place a quarter-inch of warm water in an appropriately sized plastic container, and place your boa inside with a secure lid in place. Then place the container in your boa’s cage, positioned so the inside of the container has a warm side and cool side. This will keep the water warm and the humidity high. Do not place it directly over the belly heat or under a basking bulb. A few holes in the lid or sides of the container will provide ventilation. Soak your boa in the container for up to an hour (two hours if you’re combating a particularly tough shed) and repeat as necessary. Be sure to check on your boa regularly, as they will often defecate while soaking. Change the water and clean the container if this occurs. At end of the shed cycle, remove the water and place a small towel in the container so your boa can rub on it to help shed its old skin.", "other_information": "https://www.reptilesmagazine.com/colombian-boa-constrictor-care-sheet/", "other_information_name": "Reptiles Magazine"}}, {"model": "care.care", "pk": 7, "fields": {"name": "Garter snake", "category": 1, "animal": 7, "care_guide": "he average life span in the wild may only be 4-5 years however they can live twice as long in captivity. Captives reaching over 10 years old have been documented when reptile health and wellness is prioritized along with proper snake supplies, reptile cleaning supplies, and snake habitat products.", "cage_setup": "Garters can be kept in rack systems, but are best suited for aquarium or reptile terrarium style cages. Acrylic or screen style terrariums make ideal cages and can be decorated reptile habitat accessories like wood and vines for the snake to climb around on, which provides beneficial exercise. Minimum size for and adult is a 28 quart plastic tube or a 29 gallon aquarium/terrarium. Males could be kept in slightly smaller cages than females due to their size difference. Multiple garter snakes can be kept together with more space however they should be separated for feeding to avoid incidental cannibalism. A pair of garter snakes can live comfortably in a 55 gallon size. The more space the better as garters are very active and like to climb.", "lighting": "While UV light may not be considered necessary it can be beneficial as garter snakes are active during the day in the wild using a Zoo Med ReptiSun 10.0 UVB Compact Fluorescent Reptile Lamp with the Zoo Med Repticare Day Night Timer. If UV light is not provided it is recommended to occasionally dust food items with a calcium/vitamin powder that contains D3, such as Zoo Med Repti Calcium with D3 Supplement.", "heating": "Garter snakes need a basking area between 90-95 degrees for proper digestion. Heat can be provided by either a basking lamp, heat tape (or Zilla Heat Mat) under the tank or both. As with any reptile a temperature gradient should occur in the cage with hides on both the hot and cool sides monitored by a Zilla Terrarium Heat & Habitat Lighting Controller. It is important to maintain moderate humidity for proper shedding however the cage should not be kept damp or wet as this will cause blistering on the belly. A reptile water dish large enough for the snake to submerge in will provide plenty of humidity. In the winter time when indoor house humidity is long it may be important to partially cover screen tops to maintain moderate humidity.", "feeding_schedule": "Many keepers feed adults a frozen thawed rodent only diet, which is fine because this provides complete nutrition. However in the wild garters would eat a more varied live reptile food diet consisting of worms, amphibians, fish, and rodents, so it is a good idea to provide some variety in captivity. I prefer to feed both night crawlers and rodents, which can be found in pet stores or online reptile shops. Babies are easy to start on small cut up pieces of night crawlers. Most feeder fish contain an enzyme called thiaminase, which breaks down thiamine (vitamin B1). Long term exclusive feeding of these fish should be avoided, because doing so can lead to a potentially fatal vitamin deficiency. Garters DO NOT eat crickets, mealworms or other insects.", "known_problems": "Garter snakes are generally healthy and as long as their husbandry requirements are met and should thrive in captivity.", "other_information": "https://www.reptilesmagazine.com/garter-snake-care-sheet/", "other_information_name": "Reptiles Magazine"}}, {"model": "care.care", "pk": 8, "fields": {"name": "Burmese Python", "category": 1, "animal": 8, "care_guide": "Burmese Pythons, because of their docile nature and undemanding requirements, are among the most suitable of the large snakes as captive animals. It’s been more than 35 years since I got my first Burmese, and the species still remains my favorite.\r\n\r\nThere’s no denying the popularity of the Burmese python. And as long as you’re sure you have the space to properly house one, you, too, should be able to discover why I still like them so much, after all these years. With proper snake supplies and reptile health and wellness in mind, this species is a great captive for dedicated keepers.", "cage_setup": "Most importantly, the cage should safely contain the snake. After all, subsequent requirements are less important once the snake has disappeared into that hole in the wall behind the washing machine because you forgot to properly secure it.\r\n\r\nThe size of the enclosure should be large enough to allow the snake a reasonable amount of movement, yet small enough to permit accurate temperature and humidity control. Burmese pythons are terrestrial snakes that spend most of their time on the ground, so the floor space of their enclosure will be more important to the animal than the height of the cage.\r\n\r\nA baby Burmese will require the space equivalent of a 10-gallon reptile terrariums. Larger individuals will need more space, of course. A 200-pound animal will need floor space measuring at least 4 feet by 8 feet. I recommend the enclosure have roughly the floor space equal to four to six times the area of the snake itself when it’s in a flat coil. The cage should also have a door that allows easy access and that can be closed securely. A glass or Plexiglas window for viewing is important, as well. Some ventilation is desirable, although not as much as one might initially think. Heat and humidity are easily lost through vents, especially through those on the top of the enclosure. Small vents located on the sides of the cage will permit adequate air exchange.\r\n\r\nWood, plastic and glass are all acceptable materials for cage construction. I use enclosures that are constructed of ABS plastic, and which have a smooth, nonporous finish that allows easy cleaning and sterilization.Snake habitat products may make this more difficult, so sometimes simplicity is the best option. All corners and edges are rounded, leaving no difficult-to-clean areas. The cages are lightweight, have large tempered glass viewing areas and, best of all, someone else has made them already. Regular and spot cleanings are required with proper reptile cleaning supplies.", "lighting": "A light cycle of 12 hours should be provided. No special UVB lighting is required.", "heating": "Burmese pythons prefer temperatures in the mid-80s Fahrenheit. Slightly cooler temperatures are allowable at night. Indeed, cooler night temperatures are essential to breeding Burmese pythons, should you desire to eventually undertake this endeavor.\r\n\r\nBecause Burmese pythons require temperatures above what we consider comfortable in our homes, it is necessary to raise the temperature of the enclosure with a supplemental heat source. This heat can be provided in several ways. I prefer to use a heat pad, such as the Zilla Heat Pad, or heat tape underneath the enclosure. Heat pads or undertank heaters are available in many pet shops that stock reptile supplies. They provide safe, even heating for smaller enclosures. Heat tape is also available and serves the same purpose, although it allows more flexibility in heating larger areas more economically. Various types of snake heat lamps are also available and effective, as well. There are many types of reptile heat lamps and fixtures you can choose from.\r\n\r\nIt is important, though, to give the snake some choice in determining its own temperature. In the wild, the animal would be able to thermoregulate by freely moving between warmer or cooler areas. These choices are limited in captivity, but by proper heater placement, it is possible to give the snake some control over its own temperature. You should have a hot side, and a cool side. The hot spot is species specific. The maximum thermal gradient can be obtained by placing the heater at one end of the enclosure rather than in the center. It will be warmer nearer the heater and cooler as the distance from the heater increases. This will give the snake a wider range of choices in regulating its own temperature.", "feeding_schedule": "Feeding Burmese pythons is fairly simple. I feed an appropriately sized meal whenever the snake is hungry. Baby Burmese pythons can eat an adult mouse during their first feeding, which is surprising to many novice snake keepers. Several sensory systems are operating in a feeding python. First, the food item must smell like something to eat. Second, the food item must move in the manner of a potential meal. And third, the food item must be warmer than its surroundings. Burmese pythons eat only warm-blooded prey and have sensory organs (pits) to detect the slight amount of heat generated by the body of a potential food item. A combination of these factors seems to be important in eliciting a feeding response in newborn pythons. Pinky mice normally do not move in a way that interests a baby python, and although I think they must smell like mice, they don’t generate and retain body heat very well.\r\n\r\nOnce a baby python has had its first few meals, it is possible for it to learn behaviors that allow it to recognize and eat prekilled food items, or even chicken parts or processed snake foods. It is sometimes recommended that snakes be fed only dead food items to avoid potential injury that could be inflicted by the struggling prey item. It is important to remember, though, that nearly every meal taken by a python in the history of the species has been living. Nature has prepared them well to deal with the possible associated problems. Frozen prekilled food makes things easier for us, though, and perhaps that should be the most important consideration.", "known_problems": "Snakes have only a limited ability to reason. Believe me, that statement is quite generous. Keepers can in advertently condition a snake to think (I’m being generous again) that every time the door to its cage opens it will be fed. If the snake is handled infrequently and most of its interaction with its keeper occurs during feeding time, this conditioning is reinforced. With large snakes, especially, it is important that the snake learn to differentiate feeding time from other times, and you from its dinner. It will make little difference to you what thought processes have led to your current situation as your snake’s mouth latches onto your forearm. What this means is that it’s a very good idea to be aware of your snake’s location and orientation when feeding or when servicing its cage. If a snake is acting hungry when I open the cage, I gently tap it on the nose with a rolled up newspaper. This is usually enough to let it know it’s not feeding time. It’s also best not to house more than one snake per cage, and it’s essential not to feed more than one snake in a cage at the same time.", "other_information": "https://www.reptilesmagazine.com/burmese-python-care-sheet/", "other_information_name": "Reptiles Magazine"}}, {"model": "profiles.userprofile", "pk": 1, "fields": {"user": 2, "default_phone_number": "+46737521983", "default_street_address1": "C/O Linnea Viblom", "default_street_address2": "Lågtrycksgatan 4 LGH1202", "default_town_or_city": "Göteborg", "default_county": "Västra Göteland", "default_postcode": "418 41", "default_country": "SE"}}, {"model": "checkout.order", "pk": 11, "fields": {"order_number": "FC410E5D2BB64509A31B0C378B9476E5", "user_profile": 1, "full_name": "k", "email": "kenanwright@gmail.com", "phone_number": "+46737521983", "country": "SE", "postcode": "418 41", "town_or_city": "Göteborg", "street_address1": "C/O Linnea Viblom", "street_address2": "Lågtrycksgatan 4 LGH1202", "county": "Västra Göteland", "date": "2021-08-14T14:59:27.807Z", "delivery_cost": "0.00", "order_total": "999.99", "grand_total": "999.99", "original_cart": "{\"6\": 1}", "stripe_pid": "pi_3JOOKAGtwQtrxSn90bkE36rL"}}, {"model": "checkout.orderlineitem", "pk": 12, "fields": {"order": 11, "animal": 6, "quantity": 1, "lineitem_total": "999.99"}}]
