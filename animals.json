It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List because of its wide distribution. It is threatened by hunting for its meat and for the international pet trade. This nonvenomous constrictor is the smallest of the African pythons, growing to a maximum length of 182 cm (72 in). The name 'ball python' refers to its tendency to curl into a ball when stressed or frightened.",

It is known for being alert, hardy and tame, and bearded dragon owners love watching their lizards, whether during a feeding frenzy while chasing crickets or simply interacting with each other. Bearded dragons exhibit interesting behaviors, too, such as “arm waving,” in which a female (and occasionally males) may lift a front leg in the air and “wave” it as a submissive gesture. The spiny “beard” from which the lizard gets its common name may also be extended, though it’s uncommon for tame captives to do so; dragons typically do this when alarmed.",

        "description": "The western hognose snake is a relatively small, stout-bodied snake.

Males are considerably smaller than females, with adults rarely exceeding a total length (including tail) of 40–50 cm (15–20 inches). This snake gets its common name, \"hognose\", from the modified rostral (nose) scale that is formed in an upturned manner, providing a very \"hog-like\" look. Additionally, this adaptation makes these snakes adept burrowers.\r\n\r\nThe species is not dangerous to humans, but there exists scientific debate regarding whether the mild toxins in the hognose's bite result from saliva, harmful to its preferred wild food source – toads – or an extremely mild venom produced in glands connecting to the hognose's minuscule rear fangs. In either case, no deaths or systemic effects from the extremely rare bite from this rear-fanged snake have been recorded. Although bites may uncommonly be medically significant, the species is not regarded as venomous.\r\n\r\nIn captivity, the species has been bred into about 52 different \"designer\" color morphs.",

The belly is white or cream colored. It is readily available in the pet trade due to its small size, docility and ease of care. In recent years there have been a number of new morphs made available by both commercial and hobby breeders. Some of the more popular morphs available include anerythristic Kenyan sand boas (black and white lacking orange/red simple recessive trait), albino Kenyan sand boas (lacking black pigment simple recessive), snow KSBs (double recessive combination of an anery and albino), stripes (normal colored, anerythristic, albino and snow), hypo/ghost, anerythristic KSBs, paradox albinos (simple recessive), paradox snows (double recessive trait), splash (recessive), paint (recessive) and stripe combinations with any of the listed recessive traits. In addition many line bred traits have been accentuated on the above morphs, such as Nuclears (extreme red), High Whites, Reduced Patterns as examples.",
